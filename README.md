We created a web application that solves two problems for students. Primarily, it allows students to stay connected with their friends while studying from home through this online semester, and secondly, provides a tool that will analyze their study habits to improve their productivity.

Students were forced to study remotely through COVID. With StudyBuddy, we hoped to create a virtual library environment, where students can see when their other friends are actively studying, and the courses that their friends are taking. Moreover, solutions are provided for students to stay on track through the semesters, as it was challenging for most with online school.
